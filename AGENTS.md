# The Plug — Agent Operating Contract

## Product
The Plug is a Botswana sneaker and apparel sourcing/order PWA for Frank's side business. Core proposition: If we can source it, you can get it. This is a real small-business product, not a generic demo.

## Roles and workflow
- Product owner / final reviewer: user.
- Technical navigator and implementation: ChatGPT through repository tooling.
- GitHub is the source of truth; Vercel production status must be checked independently.
- Workflow: START → INSPECT → BUILD → VERIFY → CHECKPOINT → CONTINUE/RECOVER.
- Golden rule: Unexpected result = STOP → inspect reality → then act.
- Read this file first. Inspect actual source, route tree, Firebase rules/config, recent commits, and deployment before changing code. Do not invent state.
- Make the smallest controlled changes, preserve working behavior, inspect the resulting diff, run verification, and report exact commit/deployment state. Never claim a push, fix, notification, request, or deployment succeeded without evidence.

## Customer experience — frictionless start, durable membership
- The default entry is **start without a sign-in**. Do not make Google sign-in, a password, or installation a prerequisite for exploring The Plug or starting a sourcing request.
- Where private customer data needs an authenticated identity, use Firebase Anonymous Authentication as the initial device session, only when The Plug's real Firebase web configuration is present. Do not fabricate placeholder credentials in the browser or create an anonymous identity when auth configuration is missing.
- Explain the trade-off plainly: the initial private session is tied to the browser/device. Clearing site data, losing that browser session, or switching devices before linking a credential may make that history inaccessible. Do not describe anonymous auth as a permanent account.
- Invite customers to **connect Google later** when the benefit is concrete (preserving access across devices, saved request history, and private conversations). Linking must use Firebase credential-linking so the anonymous UID and its data are preserved. Never silently sign the customer out of an anonymous session or overwrite it with a separate account.
- Handle the case where a Google credential already belongs to another Firebase UID explicitly. Do not claim that data was merged or moved; preserve the current session and explain the safe next step. Do not implement cross-account migration without a reviewed, tested data migration plan and security-rule implications.
- Phone sign-in and email/password may be offered as later alternatives, but do not add extra choice or OTP/password friction before validating the core customer journey. Google is an optional account-linking path, not a mandatory entrance gate.
- Private feed, messages, customer profile, sourcing requests and orders remain authenticated and owner-scoped. Anonymous Firebase users are authenticated users for rules purposes, but must not be treated as verified phone/email identities or admins.
- Preserve return paths through any account-linking/sign-in flow. Handle cancelled/blocked popups, unauthorized domains, network failures and sign-out with actionable, non-technical messages.
- Show member value before asking for permissions. Notification permission is optional, requested only after explaining the actual benefit and when the notification feature is ready. Do not imply permission alone proves delivery.
- Member value: private updates from Frank, new-drop/catalogue-reorganisation notices, published member offers, account-linked private inquiries, request/order status, and legitimate recorded rewards. Do not invent active offers, deadlines, winners, stock, balances or discounts.
- Customers can privately reply to an announcement with its context attached. Keep conversations scoped to their authenticated customer ID; admins remain role-controlled.
- The private feed must never feel empty: when there are no live posts, show clearly labelled evergreen programme information and examples of possible member benefits, not fake announcements or active promotions.
- If Firebase web configuration is unavailable, show a clear fallback and direct WhatsApp route; do not pretend a local/anonymous session or request submission succeeded.

## Storefront hierarchy and merchandising — non-negotiable
The Plug is the customer's primary storefront and ongoing customer relationship—not merely a landing page that sends people to WhatsApp or Instagram. Homepage copy must be concise and product-led; do not explain the business model to the customer.

### Required homepage shape
1. **Editorial hero + featured-finds rail:** fashion-media art direction and a horizontal feed of real items Frank has published, with uploaded image, concise name, confirmed price where set, and a direct ask/request action.
2. **Live offers rail:** a separate homepage section for real offers Frank has published and marked active. Expired, paused, scheduled, draft and archived offers never appear as live; an honest empty state is expected until Frank publishes one.
3. **A compact Plug Circle/member-value band:** show the return loop—requests, published drops/offers, relevant optional notifications and confirmed rewards—without fake points, false urgency, or promising membership/discounts before trusted eligibility is recorded.
4. **One clear sourcing action** for anything not listed. Account/requests and install stay easy to reach; WhatsApp catalogue and Instagram are secondary footer links.
5. Empty states should feel art-directed but remain concise and honest. Never use fake products, prices, stock, discounts, countdowns, winners or activity.

### Publishing and empty states
- The admin must eventually be able to create/edit/draft/schedule/publish/pause/archive/expire featured finds and deals. Published status and validity timestamps are the source of truth for public visibility.
- The homepage must read the real published records. Do not hard-code sample products, discounts, stock, prices, deadlines, or pretend a static placeholder is live content.
- If there are no published finds or active deals, show an intentional, honest empty state that points first to the unlisted-item sourcing journey. Only then offer WhatsApp/Instagram as alternate places to browse.
- Do not label a customer “Plug Circle” or unlock member-only pricing/rewards merely because they opened an account, linked Google, or submitted a request. Membership confirmation and benefits require explicit trusted data.
- Keep admin entry discreet at the bottom of the customer-facing page, but treat that link as navigation only. Protect every admin route and data write with server/auth/Firestore role checks; hiding a link is not security.
- Keep homepage copy extremely concise: featured slideshow + sourcing request, then a small route to requests/account. No long explanations, repetitive feature cards, multiple “why us” sections, or large standalone Plug Circle/deals explainer sections. The interface itself should lead the user into the next step.
- Before claiming this hierarchy is fully functional, verify the published-content schema, admin CRUD, Firestore/Storage rules, expiry handling, mobile layout, and real production records. A visual empty-state design is not a substitute for the publishing system.

## Customer sourcing and commercial workflow
1. Customer shares a listed item or submits a sourcing request while signed in.
2. Frank checks the sourcing route.
3. Frank confirms the current quote and delivery expectation.
4. Customer pays the agreed 50% deposit before sourcing begins.
5. Frank records the quote, deposit and order state.
6. Status progresses through sourcing to delivery/collection.
- Request flow captures product/name/link or screenshot, desired size, colour, notes and contact details.
- Never claim a quote, stock position, sourcing acceptance, deposit receipt, reward, winner, or delivery date until the business records it.
- The usual guide may be 3–4 weeks, but the actual expectation must be communicated for each order.
- If a request/session cannot be saved, keep the customer in The Plug: preserve entered details where possible, state plainly that nothing was sent, and offer a real retry or return-to-edit action. Do not use WhatsApp as a generic error escape hatch.
- BOEMO order/conversation infrastructure is a code-pattern foundation only. Remove food-specific wording and never use BOEMO Firebase project credentials, data, service-worker configuration or deployment target.

## Member feed, incentives and admin
- Add a simple admin publishing workflow: update type, title/message, audience, optional media/link, publish/schedule state and explicit validity window when applicable.
- Update types may include announcement, new drop, catalogue reorganisation, member offer, service update and winner/reward notice.
- Feed posts and offers must have clear lifecycle/status (draft, scheduled, published, expired/archived). A countdown is allowed only when a real end timestamp is saved and visible; expired offers must stop presenting as active.
- Announcement replies should open a private conversation linked to the announcement ID/title; do not expose customer messages to other customers.
- Reward/loyalty and “order lotto” outcomes must be recorded, auditable, and tied to clear rules. Never randomly or automatically claim a winner/discount without an admin-recorded outcome.
- Keep admin lightweight: sourcing requests/orders, quote/deposit recording, customer communication, announcements/offers, and verified-data preparation. Do not build an ERP.
- The verified product inventory file and unresolved-data list are a later deliverable, after the customer journey and admin publishing workflow are ready. Do not build or pay for catalogue integration until available data sources are inspected and the inventory requirements are known.
- WhatsApp Business remains the source of truth for the full external catalogue. The Plug deliberately has a separate curated editorial publishing system for homepage featured finds and live offers; it is not a full inventory mirror. Frank manages those records in Admin (draft, publish, pause, schedule with start/end time, archive, reorder, upload images, and optionally set a confirmed price). Only The Plug's own published/in-date records appear on its storefront. Links/screenshots do not prove stock, current price, sizes, authenticity or sourcing availability.

## Data and security
- Firebase rules are the security boundary, not just UI hiding. Customer profiles, requests, messages, tokens and orders must be owner-scoped; admin writes must be role-controlled.
- Review Firestore and Storage rules before adding any collection or write path. Do not loosen default-deny rules broadly.
- Never commit secrets. The Plug must use its own Firebase project. Keep environment placeholders blank only for build/prerender fallback; do not claim production auth/FCM is connected until verified.
- Do not broadly cache private customer data, private feed responses, account pages, messages, tokens or admin screens in the service worker.

## Notifications
- Reuse the proven shape of the BOEMO notification UX only, not BOEMO project settings, keys, payload assumptions or business logic.
- Web push requires HTTPS, correct Firebase web-push configuration, a service worker, browser permission, a valid registration/token, server credentials and device/browser support.
- Ask permission in context after explaining the benefit; avoid prompting on first paint. Make enable/test states explicit: unsupported, permission denied, setup incomplete, token registered, test requested, confirmed response, and failure. Never call a server HTTP response proof that the OS displayed a notification.
- A test should provide a clear next step and distinguish foreground/in-app feedback from a system notification. Keep WhatsApp as fallback where push is unavailable.

## Browser, PWA and offline
- The Plug is commonly opened from WhatsApp/social links, including embedded in-app browsers.
- Detect embedded browsers from server request headers and pass the result into one client-side PWA gate, so a branded, accessible dialog is present in the initial server-rendered HTML. No duplicate/legacy embedded-browser prompts.
- The embedded-browser gate must lock background scrolling, retain keyboard focus, prevent Escape from dismissing a blocking gate, and present one clear primary OPEN IN CHROME / OPEN IN BROWSER action. Do not strand the customer in the embedded browser with a dismiss-only control.
- The public landing page prioritizes The Plug's own live, admin-published featured finds and active deals first; confirmed Plug Circle/member value second; the sourcing journey for unlisted items third; WhatsApp catalogue and Instagram only as lower-priority fallback discovery routes when the app has no relevant live content. Never put external catalogues ahead of The Plug's own published content.
- Keep a sourcing action available throughout the page, but do not make “ask Frank to source it” the entire storefront proposition. “Install The Plug” stays visible but secondary. Installation must not be a prerequisite for browsing or requesting.
- Match the working PurePress/Admin Hub install control: an explicit “Install The Plug” click invokes the retained `beforeinstallprompt` event directly, so the browser's native installation prompt is the next screen. Do not interpose a second Android/desktop instruction modal or a “Continue in browser” detour.
- Do not auto-open a blocking install modal on page load or private/account routes. The browser/OS owns final consent. On iOS Safari only, where `beforeinstallprompt` is unavailable, a concise Share → Add to Home Screen path is acceptable.
- A missing `beforeinstallprompt` event must never make an install CTA silently do nothing. Keep a persistent branded install action visible outside standalone/embedded-gate states. If the retained native event exists, invoke it directly from the user's click. If it does not, show the branded, platform-specific fallback used by Odi: Safari Share → Add to Home Screen on iOS; concise Chrome install-menu steps on Android; Chrome/Edge install-app steps on desktop. Continue investigating manifest/installability and do not claim JavaScript can force the native prompt.
- Remember install-card dismissal across reloads for seven days, matching PurePress's respectful dismissal pattern. Clear dismissal after `appinstalled`. Installed/standalone state must suppress the install journey.
- Embedded-browser guidance remains a separate branded blocking gate with one clear OPEN IN CHROME / OPEN IN BROWSER action; do not confuse it with install promotion or show two overlays.
- Never use JavaScript alerts for install guidance. Do not present Add to Home Screen as the generic primary fallback. Browser chrome/address-bar labels are controlled by the browser/host app, not The Plug.
- Keep app shell, offline route, manifest, service-worker update flow and Firestore persistence. Cached pages are not proof that a request/message reached Frank. Show honest local/queued/syncing/confirmed/failed states; do not duplicate writes on retry.
- Use concise, purposeful emojis paired with words, visible action cues, clear status feedback and responsive layouts. Avoid stacked overlays, ambiguous buttons and decorative motion that competes with the task.

## UX and accessibility research standard
- Account friction evidence: Baymard’s delayed-account-creation research finds that interrupting users with account creation before their primary task can distract or cause abandonment; apply this directionally to The Plug, while recognizing the cited study is ecommerce checkout research rather than a Botswana sourcing-app experiment. https://baymard.com/research-articles/delayed-account-creation
- Firebase supports temporary anonymous accounts for protected data and credential linking to preserve that account’s data; this is the technical basis for frictionless entry, not a guarantee that an unlinked session survives cleared browser storage or device changes. https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/anonymous-auth
- Progressive disclosure: keep the initial choice set small and reveal account-security options when their benefit is relevant. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/
- Use current primary sources where possible: web.dev/MDN for PWA install behavior, Firebase documentation for push/auth, W3C WCAG for accessibility, and credible usability research (e.g. Nielsen Norman Group) for ecommerce hierarchy and feedback.
- Make product imagery/selection controls prominent when real verified inventory is available; use search/filter and clear next actions rather than fake product data.
- Use motion to signal state changes, focus or navigation—not as decoration. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, avoid flashing/continuous distracting motion, maintain visible focus, semantic headings, labels, keyboard operation, adequate contrast and comfortable touch targets.
- Do not use psychological research as a pretext for dark patterns, false urgency, fake scarcity, guilt, or notification coercion. Explain member value honestly and let the customer make an informed choice.


- Customer-facing copy must be short, concrete and outcome-led. Do not explain Firebase, anonymous sessions, account architecture, auth providers, or implementation details in marketing copy. Tell customers what they can do and what happens next.
- Do not repeat the same value proposition across the hero, benefits, how-it-works and account screens. Use one clear primary action, a short set of benefits, and a concise explanation of the real next step.
- The expected journey is: open The Plug → send Frank a sourcing request → Frank checks sourcing → Frank confirms price and timing → customer decides whether to proceed and pays the agreed 50% deposit before sourcing starts. The account then shows the customer’s request/status and private conversations. Do not imply that a request is already an order or that a quote/availability is confirmed.
- Keep Google account linking optional and explain it only where useful: “Connect Google to get back to your requests and messages on another device.” A short warning about losing unlinked history if browser data is cleared is acceptable in account settings; do not lead the landing page with auth details.
- Do not tell customers to configure notifications before they have a reason to want them. Notification setup belongs after there is real member value and the notification service has been verified. Keep the permission request contextual and optional.
- UX research grounding: Baymard’s checkout studies find that asking for account creation too early can distract users from their primary task; this is ecommerce evidence and should guide, not be overstated as a Botswana-specific conversion finding. Nielsen Norman Group’s progressive-disclosure guidance supports keeping the first screen focused on the most important action and revealing secondary choices only when needed. https://baymard.com/research-articles/delayed-account-creation https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/

## Verification
- For the frictionless-start/auth checkpoint, inspect anonymous-session creation, persistence, credential linking, existing-Google-account conflicts, request submission, profile ownership, conversation privacy, Storage rules, and the actual production Firebase config/provider state. Verify that missing config cannot create fake users or imply a saved request.
- Do not ask the user to paste Firebase rules just because anonymous sign-in is introduced: first compare the proposed changes with the repository’s current firestore.rules and storage.rules. If rules need changing, present the exact complete rules and the Firebase Console path, and wait for the user to paste/deploy them before claiming production writes are authorized.
- Before a meaningful checkpoint run: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
- Inspect actual diff and repository status before committing. Verify public browser/deployment behavior when tools allow it.
- Do not tell the user to QA before the source change is committed and the deployment is READY. If local verification is unavailable through repository tooling, state that limitation rather than pretending tests ran.
- Do not push speculative commits merely to trigger Vercel. Confirm the exact commit and READY deployment alias.

## Recovery
The BOEMO foundation commit remains a reference for infrastructure behavior only. If The Plug work breaks offline/auth/notification/PWA infrastructure, stop and compare the actual behavior to the foundation rather than layering fixes blindly.

## Install/auth incident hardening (2026-10-09)
- Never auto-open a blocking install modal on every route. A non-blocking branded install card may appear automatically on the public homepage only when native installation is available, or on iOS Safari's supported manual path; never show this promotion over private/account tasks. The homepage also keeps its visible hero/header CTA. Keep one install state machine; do not stack overlays or navigate/loop when dismissed.
- Install controls on every route dispatch one stable event to the root PWA controller. When a retained native install event exists, call it directly from the customer's click. The controller must not intercept route navigation or render the homepage as a fallback for private routes. Confirm /, /account, /request, and /offline each return their own route content online and offline; do not precache or return private authenticated HTML as a generic shell.
- Treat missing Firebase web configuration as a deployment configuration failure, not as a Firebase Auth user error. Never substitute fake placeholder project IDs/API keys in a live browser build and then expose raw Firebase exceptions. Keep build/prerender safe, detect configuration completeness before initializing Auth, and show a clear actionable message that Google sign-in is unavailable until the real The Plug Firebase web config is set.- Before claiming Google sign-in works, verify the production Vercel environment contains the required The Plug-specific NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* values, Google provider is enabled in that Firebase project, and the actual production domain is authorized. Never copy credentials or project settings from BOEMO or another client.
- When the install or auth experience loops, inspect route tree, PWA root component lifecycle, service-worker fetch/cache strategy, production deployment source SHA, and Vercel environment variable presence before changing code. Cache-version bumps alone are not a fix.
- UX principle: offer a clear install value proposition on the landing page before asking for installation. Respectful dismissal must leave the user on the route they chose. The browser/OS remains the final installation consent surface. If the native install event is absent, never leave the install control inert: show a branded, platform-specific fallback with concise steps, while continuing to investigate why native installability/event delivery is absent. Do not imply JavaScript can force a native prompt.


## PWA manifest single source of truth (2026-10-10)
- In this Next.js App Router project, `src/app/manifest.ts` is the canonical generated manifest route and must contain the complete installability metadata, including explicit 192×192 and 512×512 PNG icons. Do not assume `public/manifest.webmanifest` is what Chrome receives when the generated route exists.
- Whenever manifest/icon installability metadata changes, bump the service-worker cache version in `public/sw.js` so an older cached `/manifest.webmanifest` cannot keep Chrome evaluating stale metadata.
- Verify the generated production manifest and each declared icon URL, then inspect Chrome's installability diagnostics before claiming the native prompt works.


## Golden system: WhatsApp embedded browser → normal browser → install (2026-10-10)
This is a reusable product pattern, not a one-off The Plug workaround. Reproduce it for new projects and audit/upgrade it in existing projects. Treat the full journey as one intentional, tested system with two separate states: **escape the embedded browser**, then **install from the real browser**.

### Required customer journey
1. **Entry from WhatsApp or another embedded browser:** detect the in-app browser reliably. Present one branded, accessible blocking gate in the initial render, explaining briefly why opening the normal browser matters. Do not stack overlays, use JavaScript alerts, or leave only a dismiss/cancel action.
2. **One clear escape action:** provide one obvious primary action such as **OPEN IN CHROME** or **OPEN IN BROWSER**, using a valid platform-appropriate external-browser handoff/deep link when supported. Preserve a sensible fallback if the host app cannot launch the external browser. Do not claim the handoff succeeded unless it is observable.
3. **Normal-browser landing:** once the customer reaches Chrome, Safari, Edge, or another supported browser, show the real app/landing page—not a loop back into the embedded-browser gate. The embedded-browser gate and install promotion are separate UI states and must not appear as competing overlays.
4. **Visible install action:** in the normal browser, keep a clear branded **Install [App Name]** action available until the app is installed or running in standalone mode. Explain the concrete benefit briefly. Hide the install promotion in standalone mode and while the embedded-browser gate is active.
5. **Native prompt first:** retain the `beforeinstallprompt` event when the browser fires it. On the customer's explicit install-button click, invoke that retained event directly from the user gesture. Do not insert a second Android/desktop instructions modal, another “continue in browser” step, or unrelated confirmation between the click and the native prompt.
6. **Never silently fail:** if no native event is available, the install action must still respond. Open a branded, concise platform-specific help panel (iOS Safari Share → Add to Home Screen; Android Chrome install option; desktop Chrome/Edge install option) and show an actionable state. This fallback is a fallback—not proof the native prompt is broken permanently and not permission to stop investigating installability.
7. **Respect the platform:** the browser/OS controls whether the native prompt is eligible and what it looks like. JavaScript cannot force it. iOS generally needs its supported manual installation path. Do not promise a prompt on every visit or automatically open a blocking install modal on page load.
8. **Installed/dismissed states:** detect standalone/installed state and suppress the journey. If the product uses a dismissible install card, persist dismissal according to the project's documented policy and clear it after `appinstalled` where appropriate. A dismissal must not redirect the customer or block normal app use.
9. **One controller/state machine:** use a single root PWA controller and stable event contract for install CTAs across routes. Do not add duplicate listeners, competing legacy prompts, nested gates, alert boxes, or route-navigation hacks. Keep the WhatsApp handoff gate independent from the install prompt state.

### Required implementation and verification protocol
- **START → INSPECT → BUILD → VERIFY → CHECKPOINT.** Read `AGENTS.md`, inspect the actual routes/layout, root PWA controller, install buttons, manifest, icon assets, service worker/cache strategy, browser detection/handoff logic, recent Git commits, and production deployment before editing. Do not assume a cloned project's inherited install system is correct.
- For a new project, implement this journey deliberately from the start. For an existing project, map the current behavior against every step above and repair the smallest real cause; do not blindly copy code or cache-version bumps from another app.
- Inspect manifest output and every declared icon URL; verify HTTPS, standalone/display metadata, service-worker registration/scope, event capture timing, and browser-specific installability diagnostics where tools permit. Make sure early `beforeinstallprompt` capture cannot be missed due to hydration/timing.
- Test the two transitions separately: (A) opening from WhatsApp reaches the normal browser without an endless loop; (B) in the normal browser, the install button directly opens the native prompt when the event exists, and shows the branded fallback when it does not. Also test already-installed/standalone state and ordinary direct browser entry.
- Check the actual changed diff, run available type/lint/build checks, commit/push, and verify the exact Vercel deployment for the new source SHA is **READY** before asking the user to test. Do not claim live behavior based on source code, an earlier deployment, or a cached page.
- When a deployment is READY, report the commit and deployment state honestly. If public inspection is blocked or the browser cannot be driven with available tools, say exactly what could and could not be verified—never invent a successful test.
- Preserve this pattern in the destination project's `AGENTS.md` after implementing it. Record app-specific paths, handoff method, install controller/event, manifest route, service-worker cache version, test evidence, and any unresolved browser/platform limitation.

### Copyable acceptance checklist
- [ ] WhatsApp embedded entry shows one branded blocking gate with one clear open-in-browser action.
- [ ] The handoff reaches the normal browser and does not loop back into WhatsApp or strand the user.
- [ ] Normal-browser page displays one clear branded install action.
- [ ] When `beforeinstallprompt` exists, clicking Install invokes the native prompt directly.
- [ ] When it does not exist, clicking Install opens helpful branded platform-specific guidance—never a dead button.
- [ ] No stacked overlays, JavaScript alerts, duplicate controllers, or unrelated detours.
- [ ] Standalone/installed state suppresses install UI; dismissal does not hijack navigation.
- [ ] Manifest, icons, service worker, cache version, event timing, and installability were inspected.
- [ ] The exact source commit's Vercel production deployment is READY before customer QA is requested.

## Product discovery and repeat-customer behaviour
- The primary customer action is **Find something**. A customer may browse the WhatsApp Business catalogue or Instagram, then return to The Plug to submit a request; do not force the conversation or order into WhatsApp.
- “Find something that isn't listed” is a first-class sourcing journey, not an error state. Accept a product name/description, direct product URL, Instagram post/reel URL or other public source link, images/screenshots and PDF references, plus size, colour, budget, timing and other notes. Keep uploaded references private to the requesting customer and authorised admins. Clearly say that a link, image or PDF is a reference only and does not confirm availability, authenticity, price or stock.
- Support repeat shopping over time and shopping on behalf of someone else. Preserve request history in the customer's account, make it easy to submit another request, and allow a customer to explain who an item is for and when they may need it. Do not create fake purchase history or assume the same item is still available.
- Customers may discover products in social feeds, send a friend a link, or come back weeks later. The Plug should be the durable place for the request, quote, decisions and progress; Instagram/WhatsApp are discovery and direct-contact channels, not the only record of the transaction.
- First customer-flow acceptance path: land on The Plug → understand the service → browse external catalogues or choose “Find something that isn't listed” → submit product details/link/image/PDF with contact and sizing → receive an honest confirmation only after Firestore confirms the request → see it in My requests → Frank later quotes and updates it in admin → customer can track progress and contact Frank if needed.
- Until an admin-managed catalogue, featured items, deals or member publishing tools exist, render explicit, useful empty/fallback states with links to WhatsApp catalogue, Instagram and the sourcing form. Never imply that an unconfigured section has live items, active deals, or a working promotion.
- Future admin publishing should configure featured finds, deal terms/validity, announcements, customer-facing fallback copy and audience preferences from one managed source of truth. Drafts must remain private; expired/archived content must not appear active. Keep the customer flow useful before this admin exists, then connect the same records to storefront/feed/notifications rather than hard-coding a parallel system.
- Repeat shopping and referral behaviour are opportunities, not permission to spam: marketing notifications must be opt-in, service/request notifications must remain distinguishable, and any draw/reward must have clear published rules, eligibility, duplicate-entry handling, auditable selection and an admin-recorded outcome.
- Treat a saved request as an inquiry, not a confirmed order. Only Frank's recorded quote and the customer's explicit approval should move it into the commercial flow. Never claim the business has received a message, deposit or upload unless the corresponding operation is confirmed.


## Editorial storefront and publishing system — current product direction
- Treat The Plug as a fashion-media storefront and customer-retention product, not a long explainer landing page. The sequence is editorial hero → real featured finds → real live offers → concise Plug Circle return loop → sourcing action.
- Admin "Storefront studio" manages curated featured finds and offers separately from the full WhatsApp Business catalogue. It supports image uploads, confirmed optional prices, audience, lifecycle state, start/end timestamps, ordering, editing, pausing, archiving and deletion.
- Public content comes from Firestore \`storefrontContent\`; never hard-code sample items. Public reads are limited to published records for everyone, then filtered by active date. Circle-audience content is not publicly exposed; do not claim its member-facing display is complete until trusted membership-gated reads and the account feed are verified.
- Firestore rules are the security boundary. Storefront writes require the existing admin role. Images use the dedicated \`storefrontMedia\` Storage path, admin-write/public-read, image MIME only and a 12 MB limit.
- This publishing system is a curated editorial layer, not a duplicate of the entire WhatsApp catalogue. Frank must still confirm availability, price, sizes and fulfilment before a request becomes an order.
- Keep motion subtle and respect reduced-motion preferences. No false scarcity, coercive notifications, invented discounts or gamification that rewards meaningless clicks.


## The Plug Circle — referrals, privacy and repeat engagement
- Use Namane Tyres' shareable job-link pattern as a reference for low-friction sharing and a durable route back into the app; invitations are not friendships until the recipient confirms a real account and explicitly accepts.
- Keep three separate surfaces: an admin operations/moderation feed, a member's own private activity feed, and a public community feed. Friend activity is visible only to confirmed connections. Firestore rules, not UI filters, enforce each scope.
- Purchases are private by default. Members can choose private, friends-only, or public sharing. Only completed sourcing requests/orders marked Delivered or Collected may appear as purchase activity, and only at the visibility the member explicitly chose. Never publish pending requests, quotes, deposits, phone numbers, delivery details, attachments or private messages.
- Public member counts include only real, confirmed accounts whose owners opted into appearing in the community directory. Never count visitors, anonymous sessions or pending invitations as members.
- Push notifications are separate, optional opt-in. Do not subscribe people automatically from invitation links. Explain relevant benefits first and preserve in-app feed access when push is unavailable or declined.
- Keep gamification honest: real activity, actual member counts, published perks and auditable rewards only. No fake likes, streaks, purchase counts, winners, scarcity or guilt-based prompts. Privacy and notification controls must be reversible.
- Research basis: Firebase documents credential linking to preserve anonymous-session data when a user signs up (https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/anonymous-auth); Firestore rules are per-document authorization and are not filters (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/rules-structure); Nielsen Norman Group's progressive disclosure guidance supports revealing useful choices at the right time (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/). These are design principles, not proven outcomes for The Plug's Botswana audience.


## Clarified customer journey — supersedes earlier broad fallback wording
- The Plug is the primary experience. Customers browse real featured finds and published offers first; do not push WhatsApp/Instagram as a first step or make contacting Frank the default answer.
- Keep the homepage concise and product-led. Remove oversized “not on the edit?”/source-it messaging from the primary path. Sourcing remains a useful secondary path for unlisted items, not the storefront's headline.
- Buttons should produce a meaningful immediate result: reveal concise details, expand/collapse an explanation, change a selection, save a preference, or navigate to the next clearly named task. Avoid dead buttons, fake progress, and avoidable redirects between explanatory pages.
- The account/request experience must make the customer’s next step concrete. After a request is genuinely saved, show a concise visual explanation of the real account benefits and a one-tap option to link Google to the existing anonymous Firebase user. Linking must preserve the anonymous UID and existing records; never silently create a separate account or promise a merge when the credential is already in use.
- Keep WhatsApp catalogue, WhatsApp direct contact, and Instagram links at the end of the experience and expose them only to a confirmed, non-anonymous account holder. They are useful sourcing/customer-service utilities, not the main acquisition funnel. Do not show those links in anonymous-session failure screens or generic request-error messages.
- When a session or request fails, stay on-site, preserve the form where possible, clearly state whether anything was saved, and provide an actionable retry. Never imply a request was sent if it was not. Do not direct customers to Frank merely to compensate for missing Firebase configuration.
- Explain benefits progressively and briefly: (1) browse first; (2) keep requests, private replies and progress together; (3) link Google to regain access across devices; (4) opt in to relevant notifications when ready; (5) view only real published offers and recorded rewards. Do not imply a feature is live until its end-to-end behavior exists.
- Friends/circle rules: invite links are expiring and pending until a different, real non-anonymous account explicitly accepts; only then create a connection. A user must be able to remove a connection. Private, friends-only and public purchase visibility are explicit user choices. Only Delivered/Collected activity may be shared, and never expose contact details, private conversations, addresses, payment/deposit data or pending orders. Directory counts include only confirmed members who opt in; do not count visitors, anonymous sessions or pending invites.
- Notifications remain a separate explicit opt-in. Permission denied/unsupported/setup incomplete must not break in-app updates. Never equate a browser permission grant with successful delivery.
- Keep admin operations/activity, the user's private feed, confirmed-friend feed, and public community feed as distinct audiences with server/Firestore authorization. Public content must be explicitly published; never query broadly and rely on the client to hide private data.
- Use the Admin Hub Games pattern only as interaction inspiration: a short, staged sequence, clear next action, direct feedback on input, and a visible way to continue/return. Phaser's interactive objects and pointer events unify touch/mouse input; for The Plug use accessible semantic HTML buttons/inputs instead of importing Phaser.

- Apply progressive disclosure and delayed account-linking principles: don't demand confirmation before customers can browse; ask for the link at the moment a durable benefit is clear. Research: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/ and https://baymard.com/research-articles/delayed-account-creation. These are directional usability findings, not proof of outcomes for this specific Botswana product.
- PWA is part of the customer journey on every route and device: preserve embedded-browser handoff, native install prompt when available, iOS Safari instructions only when needed, standalone suppression, manifest/icon identity, service-worker update handling, offline honesty, and mobile keyboard/touch accessibility. Never auto-open install on page load or block browsing/requesting behind installation. Test public browse, request form, account linking, admin, offline/return-online, and installed standalone as separate contexts.
